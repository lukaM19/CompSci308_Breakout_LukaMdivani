This project implements the game of Breakout.

### Timeline

Start Date: 01/15/2022

Finish Date: 01/18/2022

Hours Spent:20

### Resources Used
JavaFX API docs

### Running the Program

Main class: Main.java

* Data files needed: 3 .txt files for loading levels, located in resources. ("lvl1.txt","lvl2.txt","")

Key/Mouse inputs: 

* RightArrow/LeftArrow - move paddle

Cheat keys:
* E- lengthen paddle;
* L- add lives;
* R- reset paddle and ball;
* 1,2,3- select levels;
* S- slow down the ball;

### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications: I assumed there are only three levels available.

* Known Bugs: 
1) lag between main menu and lvl1- sometimes causes the ball to start moving
before the scene has loaded in.
2) On rare occasions , the ball bounces between adjacent block, 
3) effectively travelling through them.

Extra features or interesting things we should not miss:


### Impressions
* The project was not hard but since I am a novice it was a 
challenge to get used to same aspects of Java and JavaFX. 
Overall I think it was a good introductory project to get
familiar with our environment.
